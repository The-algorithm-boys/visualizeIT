                            A graph is a mathematical structure used to model pairwise relations between objects.
                            It consists of two sets: a set of vertices (or nodes) <b>V</b> and a set of edges <b>E</b>.
                            An edge <b>e ∈ E</b> is defined as a pair of vertices <b>(u, v)</b>, where <b>u, v ∈ V</b>.
                            This can be represented as <b>G = (V, E)</b>. Written

    <h2>Application of Dijkstra Algorithm</h2>
    <p>Dijkstra's algorithm is a classic computer science tool used for finding the shortest path between nodes in a
        graph,
        which can represent, for example, road networks. Here are some practical applications:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Navigation Systems: GPS systems use Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path between locations.</li>
        <li>Network Routing: Determines the shortest path for data packets in networking.</li>
        <li>Transportation Planning: Helps in finding the most efficient routes in transit systems.</li>
        <li>Game Development: Computes paths for characters to move efficiently through virtual environments.</li>
